## Install Nerd Fonts

To make Windows Terminal able to render the icons we're using in **zsh** later, we need to install the **Nerd-Fonts** on Windows. First, go to the Nerd-Font homepage and select a Font you like. Note that not all of them work well with all zsh themes, you may need to try out different ones. Fonts that work for me are **Anonymice Nerd Font**, **Droid Sans Mono Nerd Font**, and **Hack Nerd Font**. Then, extract the archive and install all of the `.otf` Font files.
